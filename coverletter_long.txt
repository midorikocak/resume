Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for the available position at your company.

As a graduate from Sabanci University, I believe that I have strong design skills and technical skills. I develop web applications since 2001 and I am interested in various kinds of arts. You could check this art at http://www.mtkocak.com

As the lead software engineer of the company Golden & Silver S.r.o in Prague Czech Republic, I am practiced to create interactive projects between users. I sincerely believe that being revolutionary and having demand to learn new things when creating anything new is the key for success. I think I have these two conditions.

I believe that I bring new and innovative ideas and a different point of view for your company. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Mutlu Tevfik Kocak

P.S: I have a residence permit whom permits me work as a contractor.
