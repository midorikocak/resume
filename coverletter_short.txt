Hi,

I am writing for Senior PHP developer job position at your company. My name is Mutlu Kocak aka Midori. I am a world citizen, Zend Certified PHP Engineer / Computer Scientist & Engineer, and php and Cakephp enthusiast. I really like jQuery too. I code PHP and web applications since dial-up years (2001). I like to contribute and create open source software projects. You can check them at: (http://www.github.com/mtkocak) 

I am always willing to learn new things even though I have 13 years of experience. I also design as a hobby. (http://www.behance.net/mtkocak) Other than coding and design, I like music, play guitar and drums, singing in choirs since I was 7. I believe in science and I am a woman who believes in equal opportunity for everyone. So I help women, lgbt people and students free of charge.

I think I could bring a new point of vision to your company. At the end you can check my website: http://www.mtkocak.com

Yours,
Mutlu Ko√ßak | Computer Scientist & Engineer

P.S: I have permanent residence to work and live in EU.
