My name is Midori. I am a world citizen, Computer Scientist & Engineer, and php and cakephp Expert. I really like jQuery too. I code PHP and web applications since dial-up years (2001). I like to contribute and create open source software projects. You can check them at: (http://www.github.com/mtkocak) I am always willing to learn new things even though I have 13 years of experience. I also design as a hobby. (http://www.behance.net/mtkocak) Other than coding and design, I like music, play guitar and drums, singing in choirs since I was 7. I believe in science and I am a woman who believes in equal oportunity for everyone. So I help women, lgbt people and students free of charge.
